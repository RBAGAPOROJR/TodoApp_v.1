- January 12 / Friday : Starting my Lab01 activity
- 
- REQUIREMENTS :
- 1.(3 POINTS) Add a status to the task. When a new task is added, the status will be 'due' as default. The possible statuses are 'due', 'done' or 'late'. Also, the status will change the colour of the background or the border of the task. Please choose the colours you like. The colour can be a state or not, but remember that as it's directly attached to the status, it would be a redundancy.
- 2. (4 POINTS) Add the feature to edit the following attributes from the task: title and status. The change of the status MUST be done directly from the task on the list, to improve usability. In other words, the user must be able to tap a switch, checkbox or any other touchable component in the task card to easily change its status. The edit feature CAN be done the way you feel better to do.
- 3. (3 POINTS) Currently, the app allows the user to include a task without the title. Create a verification to allow the creation of the task ONLY when there is a title. Do not overcomplicate it. This could be done, for example, by simply disabling the `ADD TASK` button when the input field is empty.
